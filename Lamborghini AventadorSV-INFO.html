       EXTERIOR DESIGN <br><br><br>
Sophistication, aggressiveness, lightness, and aeronautics-inspired aerodynamics. The beauty, power, and performance of the SVJ Roadster are guaranteed by ultra-light materials, such as carbon fiber, used for the body and the removable hardtop. The body features air intakes larger than any previous model, more extended side skirts, accentuated aerodynamic profiles, and a lighter and higher-mounted exhaust system.
The hardtop is made using an innovative high-pressure RTM technology that guarantees a product of superior workmanship and quality.
The hood, front fenders, and doors are also made of ultra-light materials, providing a significant reduction in the weight of the car, where every detail is never just an end in itself, and where the emotions are the expression of truly bold performance.
        <br><br><br>
INTERIOR<br><br><br>
The technological look of carbon fiber – featured in the monocoque, which forms the cockpit and recurring in the doors, seats, central tunnel and console – coexists with a design of clear aeronautical inspiration, while the leather and Alcantara® upholstery add a boldly exclusive touch to the luxurious interiors.
Finally, the exquisite cross-stitching details and notable presence of the SVJ Roadster internal plate confer a truly unique character to this new gem of engineering and highly-refined aesthetics.
        <br><br><br>
DRIVING DYNAMICS<br><br>v
        
Each of the systems at work inside Lamborghini vehicles is a masterpiece of engineering and technology. And the Aventador SVJ Roadster incorporates all the best technologies ever developed by the company. The lateral vehicle dynamics is controlled by a steering system that acts on all four wheels via Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) and Lamborghini Rear-wheel Steering (LRS), aided by the use of active torque distribution between the front and rear axles (4WD) and aero torque vectoring (ALA). The vertical vehicle dynamics is managed by the Lamborghini Magneto-rheological suspension (LMS) and the active aerodynamics. Finally, the longitudinal dynamics relies on the four-wheel drive system (4WD), the integrated traction control and the new operative logics of the ABS. The LDVA 2.0 system combines all the information gathered through the car’s inertial platform, and determines in real time the optimal settings for any driving condition. The result is perfect performance, absolutely safe and always compelling.
