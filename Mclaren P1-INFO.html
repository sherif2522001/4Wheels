        Setting out to build the ultimate driver’s car is nothing short of a momentous challenge, even for a company steeped in racing heritage and technical expertise. The success of the McLaren P1™ is one of the proudest chapters in our long history of innovation. The strictly limited production run of 375 was sold within months of orders opening. In October 2013 customer deliveries began and the McLaren P1™ became the first hybrid supercar in the world. 

The numbers behind the McLaren P1™ are astonishing – but this isn’t a car that can be reduced to statistics. It was created to be driven, to deliver extreme performance on road and on track, to be fast, safe and supremely rewarding. The team that created it pushed boundaries and rewrote rules, and the result is a car that puts its driver at the heart of a dynamic experience like no other.
